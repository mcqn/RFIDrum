RFIDrum
=======

Beating out your own personalised rhythm when you tap your RFID card.

A simple Arduino sketch to read the ID from an SL018 RFID reader, and use it to generate a unique rhythm, which is then drummed out on some solenoids connected through a 74HC595 chip.

Needs the SL018 library at https://github.com/marcboon/RFIDuino/tree/master/SL018
